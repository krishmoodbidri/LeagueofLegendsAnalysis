I read in a journal while doing my research to multiply the results by 100 and divide it late once the output is obtained. This helps in more accurate results. I haven't done a lot of research on this, but have used this concept for task 1,2,3 and 4.

I pulled the results and divided them by 100 on excel using excel commands

I also copied a lot of information about hadoop, LoL game and map reduce from the internet for my report.

All the work submitted was done solely by me and due to time restrictions, i couldn't complete task 10 accurately. 

Apologies for any grammatical or written English errors. I am still working on my English (I studied in another language back in India).
